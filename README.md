# Ethics Presentation

## Topic - should code of conduct be mandatory for data?

## Introduction

Unlike lawyers, accountants, medics or actuaries, there is currently no requirement for data scientists to hold any specific qualification or industry membership. There is rising awareness of the harmful power of data, and a number voluntary codes of conduct have been developed.

This presentation considers how data scientists should be accredited and if a code of conduct were implemented, what the key features of this should be.
