# Ethics and Communication Project


# Topic - should code of conduct be mandatory for data?


## Background
On 16th March 2020, I gave a data ethics presentation to Data Analysis classmates at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-courses/), Edinburgh.


## Introduction
Unlike lawyers, accountants, medics or actuaries, there is currently no requirement for data scientists to hold any specific qualification or industry membership. There is rising awareness of the harmful power of data, and a number voluntary codes of conduct have been developed.


## Talking points
This presentation considers how data scientists should be accredited and if a code of conduct were implemented, what the key features of this should be.

## Approach
As there would be ten presentations that day, on a variety of data ethics subjects, I decided that it was essential to tailor my segemnt to my audience if I was to have any lasting impact.  

### So in order to maximise my engagement I decided to use:
* Humour
* Audience participation
* Examples of other codes of conduct
* Video clips and memes
* The example from DataKind UK as our instructor is heavily involved there so it was an example that was close to home
* Distillation of key ethics considerations into categories - backed up by dissecting existing examples.
* Less text and more verbal communication, discussion and reflection

## Media

### I edited a couple of video clips for emphasis and effect:
* ![Robocop (1987)](media/Robocop.mp4)
* [Robocop (1987) - I loved this film (the original!).  Its messages are still relevant even today.   
* ![Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to congress (10/04/2018)](media/Marcus.mp4)
* Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to congress (10/04/2018) - I edited this clip from CNET to highlight the point that that not only has technology and the datasphere evolved at an unprecedented pace (versus e.g. the industrial revolution), there is very little understanding from key policy makers let alone the political will to legislate for timely meaningful changes.
